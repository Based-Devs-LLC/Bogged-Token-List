    "description": "GnomeToken is a highly deflationary BEP20 token. We disrupt the mediocrity of dog coins with Gnomes. Stake GNOME to earn BNB rewards, design and mint Gnome NFTs using our NFT design-studio. we offer complete transparency and user participation in decision making via our DAO. We utilise beautiful design and smooth user experience on our dApps and website to make GnomeToken a joyful experience for all holders. Our roadmap is focused on delivering value to our investors by the memeification of Gnomes.",
